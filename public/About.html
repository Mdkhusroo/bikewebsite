<h1>All about Motorbikes</h1> <br />
<h2>How does a bike engine work?</h2>
<p>motorToday, almost all commercially available motorcycles are driven by conventional gasoline internal combustion engines, increasingly 4-strokes in all size ranges. This is because 4 stroke engines are more fuel efficient, cause less emissions and have a longer life than 2-stroke engines. In a 4-stroke engine, the working cycle is completed in 4-strokes of the piston or two revolutions of the crankshaft. This is achieved by carrying out suction, compression, expansion and exhaust processes in each stroke. The 4-strokes of a petrol engine sucking fuel-air mixture are described below.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Two stroke v/s Four stroke engines</h3>
    
    <p>Whereas in a 4 stroke engine, 2 upward strokes and 2 downward strokes constitute 1 cycle, in the two stroke engine, all four events are integrated into one simple downward stroke, and one upward stroke. In a 4 stroke engine, the spark plug only fires once every other revolution whereas in a 2 stroke engine, the engine fires on every revolution. Besides, a 2-stroke engine doesn't have valves, while a 4-stroke engine does.</p>
    
    <h3>Cooling</h3>
    <p>Most of the motorbikes can be either liquid cooled, air cooled or oil cooled. Most air cooled motorcycles take advantage of air blowing past the cylinder and cylinder head while in motion to disperse heat. Frequent, sustained stationary periods may cause overheating. So liquid-cooled bikes are safe to use in a city, where traffic may frequently be at a standstill. Some manufacturers use a hybrid cooling method where engine oil is circulated between the engine case and a small radiator. Here the oil doubles as cooling liquid, prompting the name "oil-cooling.
    
    Emissions regulations and the market demand for maximum power are driving the motorcycle industry to liquid-cooling for most motorcycles</p>
    <h3>Transmission</h3>

    <p>The engine converts the explosive energy to mechanical energy, through the reciprocating motion to rotary motion. The power developed from rotary motion is controlled by various systems in a bike. This system is known as the Transmission. The Transmission consists of the clutch, gear-box & final-drive chain all the way upto the driving wheel. The clutch is a very important "Link" in the transmission of the bike. Its primary use is to allow the rider to engage and disengage the engine from the wheels. It also takes up most of the load and vibrations from the engine and does not allow it to pass onto the rest of the transmission.</p>
    
    <p>After the clutch comes the gear-box. As the name suggests, a box having a set of gears. It allows the rider to use the optimum amount of power from the engine as and how required. The main function of the gear-box is to reduce strain on the engine by supplying efficient power at required time. For Instance, the first gear is the lowest and most sensitive gear, which helps in moving of a stationary bike without putting excessive load on the engine. On the other hand use of second gear requires relatively more acceleration and gives more strain on the engine and clutch. A lower gear serves two purposes. They serve as brakes and also improve acceleration when required. For instance, while going downhill on a lower gear provides "Braking Power" and during uphill provides extra power.</p>
